## Dbglib

`dbglib` is a .NET debugging automation library, written at CERT Polska. The goal was to create a simple reusable utility for automated dynamic extraction of malware.

`dotrunpex_dump` is a simple application of `dbglib` - a simple dynamic unpacker for dotrunpex malware.

It is a heavily rewritten fork of Mindbg (author's blog: http://lowleveldesign.wordpress.com), which in turn was inspired by mdbg.
